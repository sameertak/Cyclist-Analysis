CYCLIST is a hypothetical company located in chicago, and [my task](http://samir0951.pythonanywhere.com/report01.html#ask) was to provide insights to the marketing team to imporove the strategy of marketing so that more people tend to buy annual memberships.

The last 12 months dataset was collected from the [mentioned Website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The data is then Transformed, Cleaned and then Merged to a single csv file by Python.

After combining as the dataset was too large, R is being used to perform further analysis and vizualizations steps.

All of the work is then formated to a RMD (R Markdown) File, so as the code remains in a presentable format.

The insights gathered from the Vizualizations willl help to plan a strategy for the marketing department, so as the annual membership sales increases.
